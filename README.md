# Patient-Clinician Portal

A secure platform connecting patients (especially older adults) with verified healthcare professionals, featuring AI-assisted responses with clinical verification.

## üåü Project Overview

The Patient-Clinician Portal addresses the critical problem of healthcare misinformation, particularly affecting older adults with limited digital literacy. Our solution provides a trusted environment where patients can access reliable health information through an AI-powered system with clinical verification.

### üîç Problem Statement

- **Limited Access to Reliable Information**: Older adults struggle to find trustworthy health resources
- **Risk of Misinformation**: Limited digital literacy may lead to trusting inaccurate health advice
- **Potential Health Consequences**: Incorrect information can cause improper self-diagnosis, medication misuse, or delayed medical intervention
- **AI-Based Chatbot Limitations**: While convenient, AI responses lack medical validation

### üí° Solution

- **Secure Login & Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate access for patients and verified clinicians
- **AI-Assisted Responses with Disclaimers**: Instant AI replies clearly marked as "Not Verified by Clinicians Yet"
- **Clinician Review & Verification**: Experts approve, edit, or rewrite AI responses for accuracy
- **Elderly-Friendly Accessibility**: Large text, clear navigation, voice-to-text input, and other features for ease of use

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### For Patients:
- Three types of response indicators (unverified, verified correct, corrected by clinician)
- Emergency button for urgent clinical responses
- Text-to-speech functionality
- Speech-to-text input capability
- Large text and bright colors for visibility
- Verification notifications
- Simple, intuitive navigation

### For Clinicians:
- Secure login with license verification
- Response verification system (correct/incorrect indicators)
- Specialized routing based on medical specialization
- Dashboard for analytical insights and FAQ
